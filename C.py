#Is there a difference between the two lines below? Why?
#name = ‘john’
#name= "john"

#answer: no, "" and '' doesn't make a difference in python, you can use strings like these and it will be legit:
#"It's a green day but it's not a black one"
#also spaces are not making any difference

#What is the issue with the code below?
my_number = 5+5
#print("result is: "+my_number)
#Suggest an edit.
print("result is: ",+my_number)
